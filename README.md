# Shortly-URL-shortening-API-Challenge

This challenge is to build out a responsive landing page out of JPG static format design, integrate with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- The `input` field is empty
